# Black hole simulation: Study of gravitational lens effects
## by Arthur DÃ©taille with the help of Alessandro Roussel

With their enormous mass concentrate in a tight space black holes bends space-time itself. By doing that they changes the paths of photons on their ways to our eyes.
I will not talk about all types of Black Holes but I can say to you that this software is simulating Schawrzschild's black holes wich are static and very much simpler to compute. It's geometry is define by something we call "metric tensor" noted as g<sub>&mu;&nu;</sub>
